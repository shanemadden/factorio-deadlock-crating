[mod-setting-description]
crate_stack_ratio=Amount of Crates to store full stack of base item. Amount of items in a crate is derived from stack size of base item. Example: for vanilla stack size of 50 with crating ratio of 5 amount of items in a crate is 10
crating_technology_tiers=Every research tier introduses new crating machine and agrigates crating recepies
craft_belt_ratio=Amount of base items crating machine able to process in a second per tier.This number changes crating recepie time and as result processing speed of all crating machines. For higher tier machines speed is incremented by 15 items/s per tier. If another speed is desired manual tweak in mods code is required
vanilla_generation=Generate crating recepies for vanilla items. List of items can be changed in the mods code
